♟️ Chess in C++ (1st Semester Project of CP)

This project was developed as part of my Computer Programming (CP) course during my first semester. It is a 2-player console-based chess game built entirely in C++, demonstrating my understanding of programming fundamentals and object-oriented concepts.

🌟 Features

Two-Player Mode – Playable in the console (CUI).

Core Chess Mechanics – Implemented rules for piece movements and gameplay.

Object-Oriented Design – Built using C++ OOP principles for structured and maintainable code.

Turn-Based Gameplay – Alternating moves between Player 1 and Player 2.

🚀 Learning Outcomes

Strengthened my skills in C++ programming and logic building.

Applied OOP concepts (classes, objects, and encapsulation) in a real project.

Gained hands-on experience in building a game logic system from scratch.
